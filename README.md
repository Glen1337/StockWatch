# StockWatch
Redoing and extending the functionality of my previous Rails/React stock trading simulator using Angular 11 and ASP .Net Core 5.
Due to DB corruption and issues between Angular/Typescript and Visual Studio in the .Net Core/Angular SPA Template,
I abandoned this project and created separate projects for the UI (VS Code) and API(Visual Studio 2019) that are hosted in Azure DevOps Repos.
